### Tag Line {.has-text-align-center.wp-block-heading}

The tagline is taken from a poem from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Fellowship of the Rings:

All that is gold does not glitter,  
Not all those who wander are lost;  
The old that is strong does not wither,  
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,  
A light from the shadows shall spring;  
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,  
The crownless again shall be king.
