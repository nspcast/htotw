### Dustin&#8217; Off the Degree &#8211; The Week again {.wp-block-heading}

We talked about the origin of the week two years ago on episode 226, but we&#8217;re going to talk about again from a different angle. If you were to go to a Revelation Seminar, they would probably hide the fact that they are Adventist for roughly the first week, but once they&#8217;ve worked their way through forcing history and prophecy to line up, sin, and salvation, they get to the mark of the beast and what day to worship on.

  * Creation
  * Sabbath as a reminder of salvation
  * Week continuing unbroken ever since
  * Sabbath as a symbol of following God&#8217;s law
  * Pope changed the day of worship from Saturday to Sunday
  * French Republican Calendar &#8211; 10 Days 1793 &#8211; 10 day week abandoned in 1802
  * Soviet Calendar with 5 or 6 day work weeks 1929 &#8211; 1940
  * Some European and &#8220;Business week&#8221; calendars start on Monday with the weekend at the end

### News {.wp-block-heading}

  * Impeachment
  * [Moscow, ID home of the University of Idaho is targeted for takeover by a fundamentalist church][1]
  * [Meta-analysis of 83 studies produces &#8216;very strong&#8217; evidence for a negative relationship between intelligence and religiosity][2]
  * [Ohio House passes bill allowing student answers to be scientifically wrong due to religion][3]
  * [Kentucky Atheist Wins Legal Challenge over Special License Plate][4]
  * [Nigerian pastor dies during 40 day dry fast in the wilderness][5]
  * [With Natural News barred from most US sites, they&#8217;ve moved on to fueling the Brazilian anti-vax movement][6]
