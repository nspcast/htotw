### Dustin&#8217; off the Degree &#8211; Top Three Largest Religious Bodies {.wp-block-heading}

Returning to the series I announced a few weeks ago we’re going to start working through the largest religious bodies in the world. Some, like today’s will be grouped together since most of our listeners should have at least a basic understanding of them, but for the sake of new listeners, I want to go through at least some basics.

  1. Roman Catholic Church &#8211; 1.1 billion
  2. Sunni Islam &#8211; 1 billion
  3. Eastern Orthodox Church &#8211; 225 million
