### Crypto

  * Disclosure &#8211; I own 0.00666 Bitcoins
  * What is a block chain
  * What’s a transaction 
      * On chain
      * Off chain
  * Why is cryptocurrancy a thing? 
      * Decentralized &#8211; No one entity owns it
      * Universal &#8211; Not tied to fiat currencies
      * Private &#8211; Can’t be tracked and tied to your personal identity
  * How’s that worked? 
      * As of April 3, 2022 the top 10,000 addresses or about 0.03% (0.0277794%) own about 60% (59.16%) meaning the remaining 99.97% own the remaining 40%
      * Until China banned mining in 2021 60-70% of all mining was in China
      * Universal &#8211; Can get around sanctions
      * Private &#8211; KYC
      * Fees on transactions can easily match Paypal, Stripe, or Credit Cards
  * Criticisms 
      * Volatility &#8211; It’s gambling
      * It’s insecure &#8211; By 2017 data breaches resulted in about 1 million bitcoin being stolen from exchanges
      * An estimated 20% of bitcoin have been lost due to people losing their private keys
      * Crime &#8211; Estimated to be about 3%, but transcations still happen between KYC exchanges and Russian black market exchanges
      * Climate
