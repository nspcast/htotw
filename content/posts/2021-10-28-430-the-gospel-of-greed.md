In the news we have the Boise Town Square shooting, a GOP candidate admitting he’s a theocrat who doesn’t care about the constitution, Evangelical’s new meaning, Kerr’s new Trump prophecy, a California Sec of State candidate who’s powers of prophecy include deflecting a murderous arsonist to her witch neighbor’s house.
