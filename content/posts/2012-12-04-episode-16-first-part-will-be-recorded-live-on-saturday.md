On Saturday 12/08/12 at approximately 2:00 pm MST we will be recording the first part of Episode 16 live via Google Hangouts on Air. We&#8217;ll actually both be recording ourselves locally, but it would be really messed up if we were only talking to ourselves, not each other&#8230;.

Anyway, check back here on Saturday, December 8, 2012 at approximately 2:00 PM MST if you want the unedited live BS.
