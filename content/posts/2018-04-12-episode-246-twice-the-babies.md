Idaho state Sen Bob Nonini is running for Lt Governor and took part is a candidate forum with other candidates on the “CrossPolitic SHow and Podcast” which is a Christian political show. All three candidates agreed that abortion is murder. The host, David Shannon asked if women who get abortions should get the death penalty and Nonini agreed saying, “Yes. There should be no abortion and anyone who has an abortion should pay.”

After the backlash that he deserved for saying that he tried to backtrack on Twitter saying:

&#8220;LET ME BE CLEAR-I have always been a pro-life supporter. That means classifying abortion as murder & I believe we should consider penalties for individuals involved in these procedures. I NEVER said or agreed the death penalty should be considered.&#8221;
