**Catholic school puts counselor on leave over same-sex marriage**  
<a href="http://bit.ly/an264-counselor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/an264-counselor</a>

Shelly Fitzgerald married her then partner of 18 years in 2014 and has worked as a counselor for Roncalli High School in Indianapolis for 15 years. Someone learned of her marriage, got a copy of the marriage license, a public record, and sent it to the school administrators who ran it up the chain of command and she’s been placed on administrative leave pending her resignation or the end of her contract since she refused the option of dissolving the marriage.

At issue here are the following facts:

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ol>
    <li>
      Roncalli High School is a Catholic school.
    </li>
    <li>
      The school receives vouchers, in other words it’s publicly funded.
    </li>
    <li>
      Indiana’s religious freedom law was amended to not allow discrimination.
    </li>
  </ol>
</li>

**&#8216;In God We Trust&#8217; now must be displayed in all Florida schools, school buildings**  
<a href="http://bit.ly/an264-motto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/an264-motto</a>

Just like we talked about two weeks ago for Kentucky, Florida is also requiring that all schools display “In God We Trust” in a conspicuous place. St. Lucie Public Schools gave all schools a poster to put in their front offices. Palm Beach County School District emailed principles two signs and asked them to print and post one. Okeechobee County schools were each given a state seal, which includes the required text and have been directed to put it “in a prominent spot on each campus”. Interestingly displaying the Florida state flag would also comply.

**MRFF files complaint against US Air Force General**  
<a href="http://bit.ly/264-mrff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/264-mrff</a>

The Military Religious Freedom Foundation has sent Secretary of Defense, US Air Force Leadership, and the command at Edwards Air Force Base a 22 page letter detailing the issues they have found with Brig Gen E. John Teichert after receiving 41 complaints and conducting an investigation of the ministry he runs.

Of concern is his evangelical dominionist agenda that he pushes in a way that is allegedly unbecoming an officer and creates serious establishment clause issues and the way that he treats atheists, agnostics, Muslims, Hindus, and Mormons under his command, which is illegal discrimination.

**Saudi Arabia Orders 16,000 Students to Leave Canada Amid Escalating Clash**  
<a href="http://bit.ly/an264-saudi1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/an264-saudi1</a>  
<a href="http://bit.ly/an264-saudi2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/an264-saudi2</a>

On August 5 the Government of Canada called for the release of blogger Raif Badawi and his sister Samar, via tweet, for obvious human rights concerns. In response the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia declared the Canadian Ambassador persona non grata, recalled their own ambassador to Canada, orders all 16,000 Saudi students in Canada to find new countries to study in, canceled all flights between Saudi Arabia and Canada, and suspended investment activity in Canada. They are still selling oil to Canada.

**Saudi Arabia crucified man in Mecca while calling out Canada human rights**  
<a href="http://bit.ly/an264-saudi3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/an264-saudi3</a>

Saudi Arabia has also been going on the offense against Canada’s horrific human rights record, especially with their treatment of women. On their official Twitter account they retweeted a picture someone made of an airliner about to fly into the CN Tower. But their strongest show of moral superiority yet, they crucified a man in Mecca. Normally crucifixion is reserved for only the most heinous of crimes, homosexuality and attending government protests, but in this man’s case he was merely guilty of murder, theft, and attempted rape.

**Denmark imposes first veil ban fine on woman**  
<a href="http://bit.ly/an264-denmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/an264-denmark</a>

Danish police were called to a shopping mall over a fight between two women. One of the women was wearing a veil, the other was not and the former’s veil fell off during the fight. The police fined both women for public disorder and also fined the one woman for wearing a face veil in public.

The fine was for 1000 kroner, or about $155.

**English law applies to Islamic marriage, judge rules in divorce case**  
<a href="http://bit.ly/an264-sharia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/an264-sharia</a>

Breaking with precedent a High Court judge in London ruled that sharia marriages do fall England’s 1973 Matrimonial Causes Act. He then ruled that the marriage was void because it was “entered into in disregard of certain requirements as to the formation of marriage. It is therefore a void marriage and the wife is entitled to a decree of nullity.”

It is estimated that at least 2/3rds of Muslim women in the UK have had a religious marriage only without completing the civil marriage. This is then used by their husbands to keep them in the Sharia courts and out of the civil courts.
