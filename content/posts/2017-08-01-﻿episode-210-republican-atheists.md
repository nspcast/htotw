In this week’s episode of the Atheist Nomads we have an interview of Lauren Ell of the Republican Atheist in the second half where she tells us about her organization and we discuss whether conservative politics are compatible with humanism. In the first half we are joined by Gary Mitchel and talk about the latest news, including some of Trump’s BS.
