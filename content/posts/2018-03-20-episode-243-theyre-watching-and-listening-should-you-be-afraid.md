**<a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/gov-henry-mcmaster-allows-foster-care-agencies-in-south-carolina/article_4ec95fd6-2700-11e8-8313-1b06c3f009a9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The South Carolina governor has signed an executive order allowing foster care agencies to discriminate on the basis of religion</a>**

The Obama administration updated regulations to prohibit foster care agencies that are publicly funded and licensed from servicing only specific religions, before that they were only prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race or national origin. Last week South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster issued an executive order to undermine that regulation making it perfectly fine to discriminate on the basis of religion and he’s asked the US Department of Health and Human Services to exempt the state from the regulation.

Bill Dix is a married father of three and until last week was the anti gay “family values” Iowa state senate majority leader. He got caught on video kissing a lobbyist in a Des Moines bar.

A new Barna Group study has found that 6% of the US population identifies as atheists. More interesting than that is the generational breakdowns. They found Baby Boomers to have the fewest atheists, at 5%, Elders and Gen-Xers were average at 6%, Millennials a little higher at 7%, but Gen Z came in at a full 13%.

**<a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2018/03/gay-conversion-therapist-cured-male-patients-by-having-with-them-in-his-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Canadian gay conversion therapist got in terrible for having sex with his patients as part of their &#8220;treatment&#8221;</a>**

A Canadian psychiatrist who ran a gay conversion clinic has been found guilty by the Ontario medical regulator of sexually abusing two patients. He will also face a hearing before the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. As the regulator found, the patients “thought that the sexual activity was part of the therapy and an attempt to cure them of homosexuality by engaging in the acts, rather than fantasizing about them.” And that he “engaged in mutual masturbation and oral sex with two male patients on different occasions during therapy sessions, and once had anal intercourse with one of them in his office.”

**<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5497837/Crucified-Star-Wars-Stormtrooper-hangs-Anglican-church.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A crucified Stormtrooper has caused controversy at the Anglican church it’s displayed in</a>**

A crucified Stormtrooper was on display as the centerpiece of a stations of the cross art exhibit at a London Anglican church. Once church members saw this, they got pretty upset.

The artist explained it as “I like to think of it as a New Hope &#8211; such as in the new Star Wars film, where John Boyega rebels against the dark side and fights for something good.” He was also hoping to raise awareness about his brother who has been missing since 2003.

After a priest arrived to investigate and met with the artist and upset parishioners they agreed to move the Stormtrooper from the front of the church to the back of a hallway.

We have an update on retired Boise priest Thomas Faucher. Additional charges have been filed and his bailed was raised from a quarter of a million dollars to a full $1,000,000. He failed to secure the bail and has been booked in the Ada County jail. Not only did he possess and share large amounts of child porn, but more than 2000 of the images and videos depicted kids getting raped and some showed the torture and murder of children, adults, and animals.

More important is that fact that two people have gone to the prosecutors with allegations that he sexually abused them as children.
