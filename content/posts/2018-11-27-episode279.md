We&#8217;re joined by Lawrence Millman to talk about his book _At the End of the World: A True Story of Murder in the Arctic_ which is about the murderous cult you never heard of that rose up in the midst of a recently contacted and converted Inuit community in 1941. We talk about other black marks missionaries have left on the Tundra and a bit about his feelings about the digital revolution.
