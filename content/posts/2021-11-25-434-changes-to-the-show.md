### Discussion

Atheist Nomads 4.0

So what will the show be now?  
&#8211; Each episode will be single topic and shorter. Probably 20 &#8211; 30 minutes.  
&#8211; Some will be a ‘Dustin’ off the Degree&#8217; even though I won’t call it that any more. I also plan to increase the rigor on these.  
&#8211; Some will be discussions of specific big stories in the news.  
&#8211; Some will be discussions of concerning trends in the news.  
&#8211; Some will be discussions of random topics of interest to atheists, humanists, and/or skeptics.  
&#8211; Some will be interviews.
