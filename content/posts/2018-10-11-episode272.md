After a brief FBI investigation that didn’t question any key witnesses that resulted in a confidential report with only one copy printed that was only available to senators and a few staffers and kept under lock and key, the 53 year old Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the US Supreme Court by a vote of 50 &#8211; 48 while 164 protesters were arrested.

Lisa Murkowski was going to vote no until she agreed to abstain so that Steve Daines would not have to fly back from his daughter’s wedding. Republicans Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin all voted to confirm. All other Democrats voted against the purgering sexual predator.

The American Family Association is cheering Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation saying:

“Brett Kavanaugh is a constitutional judge who will adhere to the original intent of our Founding Fathers. Despite the sleazy tactics used against Judge Kavanaugh, he has weathered the storm.

Issues important to the American Family Association, such as sanctity of life and religious freedom, are taking on an even greater importance in our culture, and how the Supreme Court rules in these matters will affect every American for decades to come.”

**Atheist loses lawsuit against “so help me God” in citizenship oath**

Olga Paule Perrier-Bilbo has lived in the US since 2000 and only needs to swear the oath of citizenship to finally become a US citizen. She is an atheist and objected to the works “so help me God” in the oath. She was given the choice of being silent for those words or taking the secular alternative. She refused both with the argument that the secular oath should be the default and she sued in federal court. She has lost.
