The GOP is taxing churches, Tony Perkin&#8217;s wants to drive gay rights supporters from the GOP, Northern Ireland will now allow Humanist weddings, Brother Adam has figured out how men can save America.

**NEWS**

**Republican tax law hits churches**

One provision of the GOP&#8217;s tax bill was to remove deductions for fringe benefits for employees. These benefits include free parking, meals, bus passes, and the like. It was intended to offset part of the huge increase to the deficit that the tax cuts are causing, but interestingly it&#8217;s poorly worded enough that it includes nonprofits, including churches that will now have to start paying some taxes.

**Tony Perkins: We can do for gay rights what we&#8217;ve done to abortion rights**

Tony Perkin’s of the Family Research Council is quite happy that pro-choice Republicans have been driven from the party and how effective they’ve been at gutting abortion rights. Now, thanks to the retirement of Anthony Kennedy, he wants to do the same thing to gay rights.

**Northern Ireland will now recognize weddings officiated by humanists**

**Brother Adam: Godly men must save America from “bossy women and queers”**
