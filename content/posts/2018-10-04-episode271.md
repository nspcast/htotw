We are joined by Josh Hansen. In the news we have Kavanaugh, a church responding to anti-gay vandalism, a faith healing documentary, crazy NM cult, US Senate resolution to repeal blasphemy laws, the Hayabusa 2 rover, and Iceland&#8217;s proposed ban on circumcision. We also discuss raising children without religion.

Wade. When she was done she was joined by Terri Pearson’s Copeland’s Daughter and the senior pastor at the church. Let’s listen to what she had to say.
