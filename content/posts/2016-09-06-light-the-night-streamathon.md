We are raising money to support the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society&#8217;s Light the Night. The money raised will help them fund research to fight blood cancers and help patients pay their bills.

Dustin is walking for his mom who survived Hodkin&#8217;s Lymphoma in the early 1980s. You can donate at [his page][1].

Lauren is walking for her uncle Cary Studley who died of Lukemia and herÂ aunt Jody Price who died of Lymphoma. You can donate at [her page][2] as well.

The schedule for the evening, including the guests, and the details for the drinking game will be following shortly.
