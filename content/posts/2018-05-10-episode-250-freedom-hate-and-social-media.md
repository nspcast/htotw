This differs from his views on Bill Clinton in 1998:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;Private conduct does have public consequences.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;Just look at how many have already been pulled under by the wake of the president’s sin: Mr. Clinton’s wife and daughter, Ms. Lewinsky, her parents, White House staff members, friends and supporters, public officials and an unwitting American public.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;The God of the Bible says that what one does in private does matter. Mr. Clinton’s months-long extramarital sexual behavior in the Oval Office now concerns him and the rest of the world, not just his immediate family. If he will lie to or mislead his wife and daughter, those with whom he is most intimate, what will prevent him from doing the same to the American public?&#8221;

The Alliance Defending Freedom has announced that they have been dropped from Amazon’s smile program because they are listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

ADF’s president wrote Amazon about this saying:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;Although the SPLC did good work many years ago, it has devolved into a far-left propaganda machine that slanders organizations with which it disagrees and destroys the possibility of civil discourse in the process.&#8221;

Merary Melchor was excited to be able to take her girlfriend to prom after getting permission from John Tyler High School in Tyler, TX.

Atheists still aren’t welcome and Eagle Scouts still get to enlist in the military at a higher rank.
