**Gideons distribute Bibles at Idaho school, draw complaints**

Filer Intermediate School serves fourth through sixth graders in the small town of Filer near Twin Falls in central southern Idaho. On November 12th or 13th, strangely the district superintendent wasn’t sure when he talked to the Idaho Statesman, the Gideons distribute Bibles in the school cafeteria as they have every other year. This time it was different. Parents and community members complained.

As a result the school district has decided that the Gideons will not be allowed back in the school, but he will be trying to work with them to coordinate something off campus that is safe for students to get to.

**Oregon man fired for refusing to attend Bible study sessions**

Ryan Coleman is half Native American with Cherokee and Blackfoot heritage and his religious beliefs are indigenous as he identifies them. He worked as a painter for an Albany, OR construction company for six months until he was fired for refusing to attend pastor led Bible studies on the clock. He had been trying to get out of them, but his boss wouldn’t budge. Considering past legal and child custody troubles he was afraid of losing his job with this “second chance” employer, run by someone who also has a history of drug and legal issues. Finally he flat out refused to attend them and he was fired. He’s now suing for wrongful termination.
