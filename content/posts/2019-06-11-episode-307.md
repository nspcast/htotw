### NEWS {.wp-block-heading}

**[The State Department wants to base human rights on ‘Natural Law’][1]**

The US State Department is creating a new commission promoting human rights around the world. This sounds like a good thing, right?

Since this is the Trump administration you would be right to be skeptical. The commission will be defining human rights based on “Natural Law”, an old concept co-opted by the Catholic Church in the middle ages. In modern Christian Nationalist usage, “Natural Law” is marriage is between one man and one woman, abortion is murder, the only appropriate place for a woman is at home with the kids, and basically any and all conservative Christian dogma they want to push.

**[Utah school board members compare themselves to Galileo while trying to block teaching Earth is billions of years old][2]**

The Utah state school board overwhelmingly approved the new science standards by a margin of 11 to 4. The four conservatives who voted against the standards wanted “both sides” to be presented on evolution and climate change. One member tried to get the age of the earth removed from the standard and another wanted students to study whether water vapor was responsible for climate change rather than carbon.

To justify her vote Lisa Cummins said “Galileo was mocked and ridiculed. If we shut down that discussion, that’s not critical thinking.”

**[Tennessee prosecutor: Gay people not entitled to domestic violence protections][3]**

Craig Northcott is the District Attorney of Coffee County, Tennessee and special prosecutor investigating the state’s House speaker. He’s already gotten some scrutiny for claiming that Muslims don’t have constitutional rights, but NewsChannel5 from Nashville found a video from a Bible conference with some interesting views for a prosecutor.

**[Watch “Virginia Governor Ralph Northam asks for ‘votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers’][4]**

12 people died last week in a Virginia Beach mass shooting and in response Governor Ralph Northam is proposing a number of rather reasonable regulations to try to stop mass shootings and doesn’t think thoughts and prayers are enough.

**[YouTube just banned supremacist content, and thousands of channels are about to be removed][5]**

**[Idaho’s first case of measles since 2001 confirmed in Latah County][6]**
