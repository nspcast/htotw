<p><strong>Full Idaho science standards have passed the state senate committee</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/2EObjZt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="http://bit.ly/2EObjZt">http://bit.ly/2EObjZt</a></a></p>
<p>The Idaho State Senate Education Committee approved the state science standards by a vote of 6 – 3. This is the full science standards including the climate change supporting content that the House Education Committee striped out a few weeks ago. Assuming neither side wins, the full unedited standards will go into effect at the close of the legislative session.</p>
<p><strong>An Idaho State Senator yelled “Abortion is murder” at students and threatened to call the cops if the students returned to his office.</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/2CHMrwp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="http://bit.ly/2CHMrwp">http://bit.ly/2CHMrwp</a></a></p>
<p>Students from the University of Idaho went to the state capital, a 300 mile trip, to meet with state legislators to talk about bills about contraceptives and sex ed. GOP state senator Dan Foreman canceled their meeting so the students left a note and some condoms on their way to meetings with other legislators.</p>
<p>He then went out into the hall and shouted:</p>
<p>““Abortion is murder, I stand against it. I am a Roman Catholic and a conservative Republican. I think what you guys are doing stinks,”</p>
<p>After being told that that’s his choice he continued:</p>
<p>“You’re damn right it’s my choice, so stay out of my office. The next time you stand in my office you’ll be dealing with ISP”.</p>
<p>He then went to Twitter.</p>
<p>Democratic state senator Maryanne Jordan filled an ethics complaint against her colleague and said to the AP:</p>
<p>“It’s one thing to disagree with policy, it’s another thing to position something like that against another lawmaker. This type of behavior is beneath the Idaho Senate.”</p>
<p><strong>The Idaho House has introduced a resolution declaring porn a health crisis. This is modeled after the resolution Utah passed last year.</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/2F4KGij" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="http://bit.ly/2F4KGij">http://bit.ly/2F4KGij</a></a></p>
<p><strong>The Florida House has declared porn a health issue, but won’t do anything about guns which are actually killing people.</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/2sZYtBJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="http://bit.ly/2sZYtBJ">http://bit.ly/2sZYtBJ</a></a></p>
<p><strong>The Florida House passed a bill that would require “In God We Trust” to be posted in all schools.</strong></p>
<p>In response to recent events in Florida, especially in the schools, Florida state Rep Kim Daniels, a Democrat from Jacksonville who runs a ministry introduced a bill requiring that the state motto, “In God We Trust” to be posted conspicuously in every Florida public school.</p>
<p>“He is not a Republican or a Democrat. He is not black or white,” Daniels said. “He is the light, and our schools need light in them like never before.”</p>
<p>She talked about the shooting, then said, “But the real thing that needs to be addressed are issues of the heart.”</p>
<p>She’s also concerned about video games.</p>
<p>The bill passed 97-10.</p>
<p><strong>A Pennsylvania church is going to hold a blessing ceremony for AR-15s and similar rifles.</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/2Cfbuv3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="http://bit.ly/2Cfbuv3">http://bit.ly/2Cfbuv3</a></a></p>
<p>The World Peace and Unification Sanctuary in Pennsylvania is holding a blessing ceremony for semi-automatic rifles. This will allow people “to show their willingness to defend their familiars, communities and nation.” All guns will need to be unloaded and zip tied to prevent bullets from being inserted. Police have been invited to come as well.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon children missing vaccines have been sent home from school</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/2FAVfHq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="http://bit.ly/2FAVfHq">http://bit.ly/2FAVfHq</a></a></p>
<p>Oregon leads the country in non-medical exemptions for vaccines and also just passed it’s annual exclusion day. This is the day each year when students who are not up to date on their vaccines and who do not have an exemption on file are sent home until their paperwork is up to date. It also set new records for the most exclusions. These are kids whose parents have ignored several letters and phone calls and who have not bothered to get their kids their shots or fill out the really easy exemption form. It’s not anti-vaxers, it’s just apathy.</p>
<p><strong>A judge has dismissed a creationist’s lawsuit over his tax money going to teach evolution.</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/2EVtxrW" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="http://bit.ly/2EVtxrW">http://bit.ly/2EVtxrW</a></a></p>
