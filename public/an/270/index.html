Justin Murray is an atheist who has applied to be a chaplain with the Australian armed forces.

<p>Justin Murray is an atheist who has applied to be a chaplain with the Australian armed forces. Since only Christians and Jews are allowed to be chaplains, his application was rejected as was his application for an exemption to that requirement. He has since filed a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission and will have a hearing soon.</p>

Upgrading patron – SoJo<br>
New patron – Adam G<br>
Donation – Fred M</p>
<p>Fred’s donation has inspired a fundraising campaign to upgrade mics two and three. These are the mics that Lauren and guests use and I would like to upgrade them to large diaphragm mics inline with mine. The mics I’m looking at are the PR40 and RE320 and they each run $300, which by the time we get windscreens for them, upgrade Lauren’s mic stand, and pay sales tax we’ll be up to about $700 total. Any and all donations and new patronage is greatly appreciated and will help make these upgrades happen.</p>
