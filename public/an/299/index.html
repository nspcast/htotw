<p><strong><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/russia-reinstates-yoga-prisoners-after-claims-it-can-make-inmates-gay-1388664">Russia has reinstated prison yoga classes, dismissing claim from theologian that it will make prisoners gay and cause riots.</a></strong></p>
<p>Last year two Russian prisons started offering yoga classes, but then a theology professor wrote a paper claiming that it would turn the prisoners gay and lead to riots. This got the support of some right wing politicians and the prison system put it on hold and competed a study into the claims which they found to be complete bull shit and the classes have been reinstated.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/04/texas-executions-all-prisons-chaplains-banned/3362398002/">Texas prisons are banning all chaplains from executions</a></strong></p>
<p>The US Supreme Court ruled that Texas could not execute a Buddhist man without his chaplain in the chamber since they do allow Christian and Muslim chaplains to be present. If this sounds familiar, it’s because we covered a similar story from Alabama where the Muslim inmate’s request to have an Imam present was denied with the explanation being that he waited too long.</p>
<p>This time to request was apparently made early enough and it was determined that all chaplains or none needed to be allowed. Texas decided on none.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.fox32chicago.com/amp/facebook-instant/texas-lawmakers-consider-the-death-penalty-for-abortion">Texas bill would classify abortion as homicide and allow for the death penalty.</a></strong></p>
<p>In a stark change in tactics, a Texas bill would classify abortion as murder and eligible for the death penalty. Yes, this is a bill that is so “pro life” that they want the state to start executing women for ending pregnancies.</p>

<p>One of the top clerics at India’s largest Muslim seminary has issued a fatwa against women watching soccer. The rational is that women would get so distracted and aroused by all the bare thighs that they probably wouldn’t even notice if someone scores.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-measles/nyc-mayor-orders-mandatory-measles-vaccinations-after-brooklyn-outbreak-idUSKCN1RL1YB"><strong>New York City measles emergency: get vaccinated or face fine</strong></a></p>
<p>New York City has been dealing with the worst measles outbreak they’ve seen since 1991 that has been spreading through the Orthodox Jewish community since October. Previous efforts to contain the outbreak have failed and now the mayor has, in his latest emergency declaration, ordered that those who have not been vaccinated or have evidence of a previous infection will be fined $1000.</p>
