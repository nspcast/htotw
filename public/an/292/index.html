<p><strong><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pope-francis-people-constantly-accusing-church-wrongdoing-are-friends-1337056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pope Francis claims people accusing the church of wrongdoing are friends or family of the devil</a></strong></p>
<p>Ahead of the Vatican’s long awaited meeting about how to stop priests getting caught raping children, the Pope claimed that people who are repeatedly accusing the church of wrongdoing are friends or family of the devil.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/bishops-summit-consider-21-action-items-handle-prevent-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victim groups are disappointed with the 21 actions that have been proposed at the Vatican summit</a></strong></p>
<p>The Pope opened the meeting by presenting 21 actions to try to fix the issues. The first action, really the most important of them all, is to write a guidebook on how to address accusations against priests and how to avoid the problems in the first case. While the rest aren’t as vague, according to victims groups, they do nothing and will take the issue back 20 years.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/02/24/pope-francis-calls-for-all-out-battle-against-child-sex-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pope Francis calls for ‘all-out battle’ against child sex abuse but offers no solutions</a></strong></p>
<p>The Pope closed the meeting calling for an “all-out battle” against child sex abuse and outlined broad goals, but no solutions. He did, of course, have to blame it on the devil, calling priests who abuse children “tools of Satan.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2019/02/21/ca-lawmakers-bill-would-force-catholic-priests-to-report-child-sex-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California bill would make clergy mandatory reporters. The Catholic Church is not pleased</a></strong></p>
<p>The a new bill in the California Assembly would remove the exemptions clergy have from being mandatory reporters. The Catholic church views this as a direct attack on the church since they view the secrecy of the confessional to be among the most sacred things in the world.</p>

<p>The Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News have found 220 pastors, deacons, volunteers, and Sunday School teachers at Southern Baptist churches that have been convicted of sexually abusing church members over the last 20 years. This is not the 380 who had credible accusations leveled against them by more than 700 victims, this is not the more than 250 who have faced criminal charges, this is 220 people with power in the Southern Baptist Church who have been convicted in a court of law by a jury of their peers of using that power for sex with adults and children as young as 3.</p>
