<p><strong>DUSTIN’ OFF THE DEGREE – Prophecy Unsealed</strong></p>
<p>It’s not often I’m excited about junk mail, and then the “Prophecy Unsealed” advertisement arrived.</p>
<p><strong>NEWS</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bust.com/sex/194437-the-purity-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatever Happened To Those Girls Who Signed ‘Purity Pledges’?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2019/01/15/southern-baptist-leader-rejects-toxic-masculinity-guidelines-as-anti-christian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Head of the Southern Baptist Seminary thinks the concept of “toxic masculinity” is anti-Christian</a></strong></p>
<p>In August the American Psychological Association released a report with guidelines for mental health professionals to follow in addressing the toxic effects of traditional masculinity ideology. Areas they have identified as particularly toxic are self reliance, “anti-femininity, achievement, eschewal of the appearance of weakness, and adventure, risk, and violence”.</p>
<p>Now, let’s bring in Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and a member of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. He said that the APA guidelines cannot “be honestly and consistently squared with any form of historic biblical Christianity.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/boise-mass-stabbing-suspect-wants-to-change-name-to-eternal-love/277-fcf2ccf4-fb11-45c4-8068-79c581e86c64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suspect in last year’s refugee stabbing in Boise wants to change name to ‘Eternal Love’ because that’s the name God has given him</a> but <a href="https://idahonews.com/news/local/mass-stabbing-suspect-headed-to-prison-for-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s not fit for trial</a></strong></p>
<p>Last month Timmy Kinner who is awaiting trial for last year’s fatal refugee stabbing in Boise filed a petition with the court to change name to ‘Eternal Love’. Why? As it put it “this is my God-given right and the title I want to be known as and remembered by.”</p>
<p>This petition is not likely to go anywhere considering the judge has found him unfit to stand for trial and committed him to the Idaho Secure Medical Facility at the Idaho State Maximum Security Institution.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/gov-little-climate-change-is-real-must-be-reversed/277-117a388f-d1ad-4e85-b583-b53f00328193" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gov Little: Climate change is real and we need to do something about it</a></strong></p>
<p>A the Idaho Environment Forum Idaho’s new governor, Brad Little, acknowledged climate change is real and must be addressed, both to minimize it getting worse and to protect the state from its effects. Apparently climate change is obvious enough here that the Republican governor of one of the most Republican states might actually start taking it seriously.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/14/christian-nationalists-bills-religious-freedom-project-blitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The blitz for theocracy in state legislatures has started</a></strong></p>
<p>The Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation released their 140 page Project Blitz playbook last year and with the aim to quote “protect religious freedom, preserve America’s Judeo-Christian heritage and promote prayer”. And it’s underway. Across the states there are bills to put “in God We Trust” in public buildings, on cop cars, and in schools. There are bills to have Christian Bible study classes, religious freedom acts to protect anti-gay discrimination, and so much more. We will be talking about these bills, but as a general rule, we only cover crazy and horrible state legislation when it’s been passed by a one of the houses of a state legislature. The reason for this is the states are the test bed for democracy, and all kinds of crazy gets introduced and most of it doesn’t even see a committee.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2019/01/16/a-christian-homeless-shelter-is-suing-over-the-right-to-reject-trans-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian homeless shelter is suing Anchorage because they want to be able to turn away trans people</a></strong></p>
<p>The city of Anchorage, AK has a non-discrimination ordinance that includes gender identity and is investigating Christian run women’s shelter for turning away a transwoman. In response to this investigation the so-called Alliance Defending Freedom is suing the city on behalf of the shelter claiming that it violates the privacy of the women in the shelter and violates the shelter’s religious freedom.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/pastafarianism-is-satire-and-not-protected-religion-court-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judge rules Pastafarianism a parody, not a religion</a></strong></p>
<p>A Nebraska man who is serving a 4-8 year sentence for assault and weapons charges sued the Nebraska State Penitentiary for violating his religious freedom. The federal judge dismissed his case ruling that the Church if the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a parody, not a religion, and thus not entitled to conditional protections.</p>
