The website is hosted on a Linode with 2 GB of ram running a Debian 12 LAMP stack. Media Files and the RSS feed are hosted on Buzzsprout.</p>
<p>The logo was designed by Lauren. The text is using the <a href="https://font.ubuntu.com/" rel="noopener">TTF-Ubuntu</a> Medium font and the image was edited using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" rel="noopener">GIMP</a>.</p>
<h3 class="has-text-align-center.wp-block-heading" id="tag-line">Tag Line</h3>
<p>The tagline is taken from a poem from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Fellowship of the Rings:</p>
<p>All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
Not all those who wander are lost;<br>
The old that is strong does not wither,<br>
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</p>
<p>From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring;<br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
The crownless again shall be king.</p>
