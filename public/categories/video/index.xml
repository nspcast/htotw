      <description>On Saturday 12/08/12 at approximately 2:00 pm MST we will be recording the first part of Episode 16 live via Google Hangouts on Air. We’ll actually both be recording ourselves locally, but it would be really messed up if we were only talking to ourselves, not each other….
Anyway, check back here on Saturday, December 8, 2012 at approximately 2:00 PM MST if you want the unedited live BS.</description>
